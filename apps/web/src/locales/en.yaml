    ### Article 1 - Purpose 

    The purpose of these terms of use (hereinafter referred to as the "TU") is to define the conditions under which any person (hereinafter referred to as the "User") may access, consult or use the Platform.

    By accessing, consulting or using the Platform, the User agrees to accept without reservation the TU and to abide by its terms. In the event that the User does not accept all or part of the TU, he/she is requested to cease all use of the Platform. 

    These TU may be modified at any time without notice. The User should therefore check the Platform regularly to keep informed of any changes or updates to the TU.

    In addition to the terms defined above, the following terms shall have the following meaning: 

    "**Account**" refers to the user account created in order to access the Games available on the Platform. 

    "**Content**" refers to any content, data, information, video, image, recording, statement, comment, message, document, published by a User on the Chat.

    "**Chat**" refers to the written messaging and video system accessible by Users while playing a Game.

    "**Games**" refers to the games made available to Users on the Platform.

    "**Player(s)**" refers to any person who has created an Account.

    ### Article 3 - Use of the Platform

    #### 3.1 Free access

    The Platform is accessible free of charge by any User with Internet access. 

    All costs incurred by the User in accessing the Platform remain at the User's expense.

    #### 3.2 Creating an Account

    In order to access and play the Games available on the Platform, the User must register and connect to the Platform via a Third Party Service. 

    The collection, use and disclosure of User information resulting from these actions will be subject to the privacy policy of the Third Party Service chosen by the User. Where permitted by the privacy policy, the Publisher will be provided with the User's first name, last name, avatar and nickname. 

    By virtue of the OAuth2 protocol used to connect to the Third Party Service, the User will be notified of the information transmitted to the Publisher. If the User rejects the use of this data, the Platform will not be accessible to him/her. 

    Once registration and connection to the Platform has been completed using a Third-Party Service, an Account is created. 

    When connecting to the Platform for the first time, the User declares by ticking a box that he/she is over 15 years of age or that he/she has been authorized by one of his/her parents or the holder of parental authority to use his/her surname, first names, e-mail address, avatar and nickname (hereinafter referred to as the "Minor's Personal Data") to create the Account, access the Platform and play the Games.

    #### 3.3 Multiplayer Games

    The Games made available to Players may be played in multi-player mode, whereby each Player may create a game by inviting the Player(s) of his or her choice, subject to the acceptance of the invited Player to participate in the game. 

    #### 3.4 Chat 

    When a game is played in multi-player mode, a chat room is made available to Players to enable them to exchange any Content in writing or by video. 

    This Content is accessible only by Players in the same game. All Content is accessible for as long as the Player retains the game in which the Content was exchanged, and until such time as the Player decides to delete the game. As an exception, Content exchanged via video is not recorded.

    ### Article 4 - Warranty and liability of the Publisher

    #### 4.1 Platform operation

    The Publisher uses all reasonable means at its disposal to ensure the availability of the Platform 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, with the exception of cases of force majeure and maintenance operations or problems affecting telecommunications networks. 

    Accordingly, the Publisher shall not be held liable for : 

    - any Internet connection problem attributable to any equipment and/or operator used by the User;

    The Publisher cannot in any way be held responsible for the provision of these links enabling access to external sites and sources, and cannot accept any responsibility for the content, advertising, products, services or any other material available on or from these external sites or sources, which are neither verified nor approved by the Publisher.

    #### 4.3 User behaviour

    The Publisher shall not be held liable for the consequences of a User's breach of his or her obligations under the TU, for a User's failure to comply with his or her obligations, or for any damage caused by one User to another, in particular as a result of Content shared in chat during multi-player games. 

    It is the responsibility of each User to report any Content he or she considers inappropriate to the Publisher by sending a written notice to the following address: [support@tabulous.fr](mailto:support@tabulous.fr).

    ### Article 5 - User obligations

    #### 5.1 User obligations

    The User undertakes to :

    The Minor's Personal Data is kept by the Publisher for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. After this period, all the Minor's Personal Data will be deleted or made anonymous.

    A parent or legal guardian may control, delete, modify or oppose the collection of Personal Data of the Minor concerning his/her child by sending a request to the following address: [support@tabulous.fr](mailto:support@tabulous.fr).
